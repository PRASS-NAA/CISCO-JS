when the execution context is created and memory allocation phase is finished,
all variables are assigned to undefined and all functions store the whole code of function as value
that's y when we access a variable bfr assigning value to variable it shows undefined
and when we call a function bfr definition, function is properly executed.

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
